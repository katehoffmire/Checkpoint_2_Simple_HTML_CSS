	<h1>Rock Quilts</h1>
	<p>For the last few years I have been constructing what I call "rock quilts" in nature. 
		On hikes or on beaches I collect a series of rocks or other natural material and 
		create a quilt on a flat surface of the ccollection I have gathered. This tradition 
		has followed me in my travels and provides me with a sense of connection with the 
		places I am in. <p>

        <img src = "images/rock_quilt9.jpg" alt="Hand holding a small collection of white rocks" width="200"/>
    <p>Since starting the practice I have introduced the idea to friends who have sent me 
		photos of their own rock quilts they have created during their adventures. While 
		some may consider it interfering with natural beauty, I consider it an opportunity 
		to reflect on the beauty within nature and to see the dazzling diversity of natural 
		phenomena all around us. <p>
